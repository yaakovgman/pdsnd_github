Bikeshare Project

### Description
# **Summary**
The project was to create a prompt that would ask a user what data they would like to pull and analyze.

There were three databases for three different cities that the user was to be able to pull from. Chicago, Washington, and New York.

The user was to be able to narrow results and specify which month and day of the week they would like to see.

Once they answered the 3 questions in the prompt about what city, month, and day they wanted to see the would get a bunch of really cool data points.
